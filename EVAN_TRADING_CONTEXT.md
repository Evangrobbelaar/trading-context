---

## INSTRUMENT RULES

### XAUUSD (Gold) — PRIMARY INSTRUMENT
- 1 unit MAXIMUM. NEVER 3 units. Never.
- ~R16/pt at 1 unit
- 3 units = ~R48/pt = R1,000+ risk on 21pt SL (confirmed by platform screenshot)
- Pending stop orders DO NOT work on XAUUSD — market orders only
- Minimum SL buffer: 15-25 pts
- XAUUSD247: weekends only, spread 8x wider (2.37 vs 0.19) — exceptional setups only

### FOREX (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY)
- 0.01 lots overnight swing trades
- 0.03 lots intraday during London/NY open
- Never exceed 0.03 lots on R2,000 account
- Minimum SL buffer: 15-25 pips
- GBPUSD at 0.10 lots = ~R16/pip (similar value to Gold 1 unit)

### NAS100 / INDICES
- At 0.01 lots = ~R1.30/pt — not worth it
- Avoid until account grows to R5,000+
- Minimum SL buffer: 80-150 pts

### AVOID ENTIRELY
- WTI (Crude Oil) — too news/spread driven
- BTCUSD/ETHUSD — $15 spread, random spikes, no clean structure
- GER40 overnight — wide spread, no liquidity

---

## SESSION SCHEDULE (SAST = UTC+2)
| Session | SAST Time | Best Instruments |
|---|---|---|
| Asian | Midnight-7am | Forex, Gold, Crypto |
| London open | 9am-12pm | Gold, EURUSD, GBPUSD (BEST) |
| London/NY overlap | 3pm-6pm | Gold, NAS100, SPX500 |
| NY close | 10pm | Wind down |
| Weekend | Sat/Sun | Markets closed (XAUUSD247 only) |

---

## NEWS CALENDAR RULES
- Always web_search news before every trade session
- High impact events: NFP, CPI, Fed speeches, JOLTS, ADP, PMI, GDP
- Avoid new entries within 2 hours BEFORE high impact news
- NFP drops Fridays at 2:30pm SAST — no trades before 4:30pm SAST
- Directional bias:
  - Stagflation/geopolitical risk = bullish Gold
  - Rate hike fears/strong USD = bearish Gold
  - Strong jobs beat (NFP/ADP) = USD up = Gold down
  - Weak jobs data = USD down = Gold up
- Post-news: wait for M15 compression + double bottom/top before entering (Rule 12)

---

## PRE-TRADE CHECKLIST (run before every single trade)
1. News scan done? Any events within 2 hours?
2. Correct session for this instrument?
3. 5+ instruments scanned? Is this the best setup?
4. H4 confirms trend direction?
5. H1 shows pullback/consolidation?
6. M15 shows structure breaking in trend direction?
7. Lot size correct for account and instrument?
8. SL behind structural level with correct buffer?
9. R:R minimum 1.2:1?
10. Risk per trade under 20% of account?

---

## PRE-TRAIL CHECKLIST (before every SL move)
1. Has price made a new swing point in my direction?
2. Is the new SL behind a structural level?
3. Is the buffer wider than the instrument noise zone?
4. Am I trailing out of fear or because structure changed? If fear — LEAVE IT.

---

## TRADING RULES

Rule 1: Never trail SL to breakeven. Trail to nearest structural level with room to breathe.
Rule 2: Min buffers: Forex 15-25 pips, Gold 15-25 pts, Indices 80-150 pts. SL outside noise zone.
Rule 3: Only trail after new swing point confirms in trade direction. No trailing just because in profit.
Rule 4: 50% rule — at 50%+ of TP, assess momentum. If candles are shrinking, pace is slowing, or price stalls for 2+ candles = CLOSE immediately. If momentum is still strong (large candles, fast movement) = hold to TP. Never let a winning trade reverse back to entry because momentum died and Claude didn't act.
Rule 5: Cut losers fast, let winners run. Bounce hard off TP area and reverses — close immediately.
Rule 6: Match instrument to session. Asian: Forex/Gold/Crypto. London: EUR/GBP/Gold. NY: NAS100/SPX500/Gold. Never trade closed markets.
Rule 7: Always scan 5+ instruments. Best setup wins — not the first one found.
Rule 8: Sizing for ~R2,000 account: 0.01 lots overnight, 0.03 lots intraday. Gold: 1 unit MAX. Rule 2 always overrides sizing.
Rule 9: H4+H1+M15 confluence = entry. Min R:R 1.2:1. Set TP, let it fill. Never move TP out of greed.
Rule 10: Cut dead trades only after BOTH: hours open with no TP progress AND structure weakened.
Rule 11: News scan before every trade. Avoid within 2 hours of major news. Use for directional bias.
Rule 12: Post-news Gold — wait for M15 compression and double bottom/top. Never chase the spike.
Rule 13: At 60%+ of TP with stalling momentum near S/R — close manually and bank profit.

---

## CRITICAL LESSONS (never repeat these)

1. GOLD 3 UNITS = ACCOUNT KILLER. R1,042 SL risk on 21pt stop confirmed by screenshot. 1 unit ONLY.
2. NAS100 at 0.01 lots = R1.30/pt. 150pt target = R195. Not worth it on this account size.
3. Never trail SL to breakeven. Lost R73 on XAUUSD short — 4pt buffer on 25pt instrument. Gold hit stop then continued right direction.
4. Dead trades kill opportunity. USDJPY held overnight zero progress. Cut after one full session if structure weakens.
5. Spread kills scalping. AI latency makes true scalping unreliable — execution speed is the bottleneck.
6. Post-news bounces work. JOLTS crashed Gold to 4,447 — double bottom — bounced to 4,473 = R205. Always wait for M15 compression first.
7. Bank profit when momentum stalls. Closed Gold buy at +R205 instead of last 15pts — right call, momentum fading into resistance.
8. ThinkTrader MCP drops after extended inactivity. New conversation to reconnect. Verify account at session start.
9. Always determine time from market data — never ask Evan what time it is.
10. AI memory rules unreliable for process steps. THIS GitHub document is single source of truth. Always fetch first.
11. If Claude has not confirmed "Context loaded" — tell it: "Read your context file first."
12. Claude can commit to GitHub directly using bash git commands. No need to ask Evan to paste files manually.

## UPDATE — June 5, 2026 (post-NFP)

NFP Result: 172,000 jobs added vs 85,000 forecast — massive beat.
Gold reaction: Crashed from 4,481 to 4,314 — a 167pt drop.
USD surged ~30pts on Dollar Index.

No trades placed post-NFP — correct decision. Rule 12 compression never formed.
Gold continued lower all afternoon with no bounce structure.

Key lesson: After a massive NFP beat, Gold can fall 150+ pts without a clean bounce setup.
Do not try to catch the falling knife on strong NFP days. Wait for Monday reset.

Week of June 1-5 final P&L:
| Date | Trade | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Jun 2026 | XAUUSD Sell | +R594 |
| 1 Jun 2026 | XAUUSD Buy | +R205 |

| Week total | | +R946 |

## PRE-TRADE ENFORCER — MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL
Version added: 1.3 — June 5, 2026

This protocol is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Claude MUST complete this BEFORE calling create_market_order on ANY trade. No exceptions. No shortcuts. If Claude skips this, Evan must say "Run the enforcer first."

### ENFORCER TEMPLATE
Claude must output this EXACTLY before every trade execution:

```
=== PRE-TRADE ENFORCER ===
Instrument: [instrument]
Direction: [Buy/Sell]
Entry: [price]
SL: [price] ([X] pts/pips from entry)
TP: [price] ([X] pts/pips from entry)
Size: [lots/units]
R:R: [X:1]

CHECKLIST:
1. News scan done? No events within 2 hours?         [✅/❌]
2. Correct session for this instrument?               [✅/❌]
3. 5+ instruments scanned? This is the best setup?   [✅/❌]
4. H4 confirms trend direction?                       [✅/❌]
5. H1 shows pullback/consolidation?                  [✅/❌]
6. M15 shows structure breaking in trend direction?  [✅/❌]
7. Lot size correct for account and instrument?       [✅/❌]
8. SL behind structural level with correct buffer?   [✅/❌]
9. R:R minimum 1.2:1?                                [✅/❌]
10. Risk under 20% of account?                        [✅/❌]

RESULT: [ALL PASSED — EXECUTING] or [FAILED — ITEM X — NOT PLACING]
=========================
```

### ENFORCER RULES
- ALL 10 items must return ✅ before execution
- A single ❌ = trade does not get placed — no exceptions
- If ANY item fails, Claude must explain why and what needs to change
- Claude must calculate R:R and risk % explicitly — no estimating
- For Gold: Item 7 must confirm "1 unit" — never 3 units
- For Forex: Item 7 must confirm lot size vs account size
- The enforcer output must appear BEFORE the create_market_order call
- If Claude executes without showing the enforcer — Evan says "Enforcer first" and Claude cancels and reruns

### ENFORCER EXAMPLES

GOOD — trade placed:
```
=== PRE-TRADE ENFORCER ===
Instrument: XAUUSD
Direction: Buy
Entry: 4,461
SL: 4,442 (19pts)
TP: 4,490 (29pts)
Size: 1 unit
R:R: 1.5:1

1. News scan done? No JOLTS/NFP/Fed today              ✅
2. London session — correct for Gold                   ✅
3. Scanned Gold, NAS100, EUR, GBP, JPY — Gold best    ✅
4. H4 bullish — higher lows from 4,366                ✅
5. H1 pulled back from 4,595 HOD to 4,447             ✅
6. M15 double bottom at 4,447 — bounce forming        ✅
7. 1 unit Gold — correct per Rule 8                   ✅
8. SL below double bottom with 19pt buffer            ✅
9. R:R = 1.5:1 — above 1.2 minimum                   ✅
10. Risk = 19pts x R16 = R304 = 15% account           ✅

RESULT: ALL PASSED — EXECUTING
=========================
```

BAD — trade blocked:
```
=== PRE-TRADE ENFORCER ===
Instrument: XAUUSD
Direction: Buy
Entry: 4,461
SL: 4,442 (19pts)
TP: 4,490 (29pts)
Size: 3 units
R:R: 1.5:1

1. News scan done?                                     ✅
2. Correct session?                                    ✅
3. 5+ instruments scanned?                             ✅
4. H4 confirms trend?                                  ✅
5. H1 pullback?                                        ✅
6. M15 structure?                                      ✅
7. Lot size correct? 3 units = R48/pt = R912 risk      ❌
8. SL behind structure?                                ✅
9. R:R 1.5:1                                           ✅
10. Risk under 20%? R912 = 44% of account              ❌

RESULT: FAILED — ITEMS 7 AND 10 — NOT PLACING
Reason: Gold sizing is 3 units — MAXIMUM is 1 unit per Rule 8.
Fix: Reduce to 1 unit and rerun enforcer.
=========================
```

## UPDATE — June 8, 2026 (Monday Weekly Update)

Monday open context:
- Gold closed Friday at ~4,366 (NFP crash: 4,481 → 4,314, partial weekend recovery)
- Weekend XAUUSD247 range: 4,290–4,320, spread 4.06pts (8x normal)
- Yearly open support: 4,319 — critical level this week
- No trades placed over the weekend — correct (spread + no structure)

Week plan:
- Monday: Watch London open 9am SAST. Wait for M15 compression at 4,319 support or break below it.
  - Scenario A (above 4,319 holds): Long with SL below 4,300, TP 4,370 (~2.5:1)
  - Scenario B (breaks below 4,319): Short on pullback, SL above 4,340, TP 4,270 (~2.5:1)
- Tuesday: NO TRADES before 16:30 SAST (CPI at 14:30 SAST)
- Live account: R65.89 — too small to trade. Fund to R1,000 minimum before any live trades.

2. Claude reading this section aloud in full as a recap before executing close
3. Evan confirming after hearing the recap

If Claude is in any other conversation and sees these positions open — DO NOT CLOSE. Say: "This appears to be a tagged SWING position. Please review EVAN_TRADING_CONTEXT.md before closing."

## UPDATE — June 8, 2026 (Monday Session Trades)

### Trades placed and closed today:

| Time | Trade | Entry | Exit | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11:10 SAST | USDJPY Buy (live) | 160.275 | 160.10 SL | -R19 | SL too tight post-NFP, Monday retracement |
| 11:15 SAST | GBPUSD Sell (demo) | 1.33243 | 1.33400 manual close | -R83 | Structure reversed — M15 flipped bullish, closed before SL |
| 11:50 SAST | NVIDIA Buy (demo) | 208.48 | OPEN | — | Swing position [SWING] — see lock protocol |

### Lessons learned today:
- Post-NFP pairs (especially JPY) need wider SLs on Monday — retracement volatility is 1.5-2x normal
- GBPUSD short thesis was valid (USD strength) but London session saw GBP recover — check if news catalyst drove reversal before next GBP short
- Cutting at -R83 vs waiting for -R140 SL = correct Rule 5 application. Saved R57.
- Demo session P&L today: -R83 (GBPUSD) | NVIDIA open
- Live session P&L today: -R19 (USDJPY)
- Live account balance: R47.16

### Monday June 8 net: -R102 demo intraday | NVIDIA swing open

## JUNE 8 — LEARNINGS FOR EVAN TO CURATE

### SESSION MECHANICS — what worked
- SL trail to breakeven rule saved multiple positions from turning losses
- Cutting GBPUSD at -R83 (Rule 5) saved R57 vs waiting for SL
- Gold first trade: entry 4332, SL trailed to 4323 — locked R179 automatically
- EURUSD cut early when SL distance was only 7p — avoided potential -R95 loss
- Multi-instrument USD shorts (GBP + EUR + Gold) all fired together on same thesis = valid approach
- NY open is the best session — most of the day's profit came after 15:30 SAST

### SESSION MECHANICS — what didn't work
- Re-entering a trade immediately after manual close at tight SL = stop hunt risk (GBPUSD live trade 2)
- Taking 3 live trades in quick succession on a R47 account = account drawn down to R41.73
- Gold re-entry (second XAUUSD short) entered at wrong time — bounced hard against us, -R211
- EURUSD 0.06L double down — aggressive sizing caught a bounce, required early exit
- Post-NFP Monday pairs (JPY especially) have 1.5-2x normal retracement volatility — wider SLs needed

### LIVE ACCOUNT INSIGHTS
- R47 is too small to trade safely — any SL under 20 pips risks 40%+ of account
- Tight SLs (4-7 pips) get stopped by spread noise and stop hunts
- Three live trades all lost or barely broke even — need minimum R300-500 deposit
- GBPUSD at 0.01L with 6-7p SL = structural problem, not bad trading
- One trade that worked (manual close +R14.52) worked because we managed it manually not via SL

### INSTRUMENT INSIGHTS
- XAUUSD (Gold): R18.20/pt at 0.01 lots. Highly profitable when right but punishing when wrong. Need 20pt+ SL minimum.
- GBPUSD: R5.46/pip at 0.03L. Most consistent performer today — two separate setups both worked directionally.
- EURUSD: R5.46/pip at 0.03L. Similar to GBP, same USD thesis. More volatile during NY session — watch HOD/LOD carefully.
- USDJPY: Post-NFP USD spike faded Monday — wrong entry timing, not wrong thesis.
- NVIDIA (shares): R1.82/dollar at 0.1L. Swing only — too slow for intraday. NY session noise ±$2.
- TM_VOLATILITY_50 (synthetic): Could not place orders — likely account permissions issue. Revisit.
- UK shares (LLOYDS etc): P&L too small at 0.01L (R0.23/pt) — not viable for small account.

### STRATEGY INSIGHTS
- USD strength theme post-NFP is a multi-day thesis — GBP and EUR shorts work on this
- Mean reversion: Gold oscillated 4268-4353 all day. Selling HOD rejections is valid.
- Double-down works IF sizing is controlled AND entry is at clear S/R — aggressive sizing on bounces dangerous
- Swing positions (NVIDIA) should be completely separate from intraday — different timeframe, different rules
- INTEL thesis still valid but entered downtrend — wait for H1 base to form before swing entry (~$95-$97 or recovery above $102)

### RULES TO CONSIDER (for Evan to decide)
- [ ] Add post-NFP rule: widen SL by 50% on all pairs for first 2 London sessions after NFP
- [ ] Add re-entry rule: minimum 15 min cooldown after manual close before re-entering same instrument same direction
- [ ] Add live account rule: maximum 1 live trade per session until balance exceeds R300
- [ ] Add double-down rule: maximum 0.06L total on any single instrument during double-down
- [ ] Consider adding: mandatory 25% progress before SL trail (currently doing this informally)
- [ ] Consider adding: CPI/FOMC rule — no new positions within 48hrs of high-impact event (currently 24hr)
- [ ] Live account deposit target: R300 minimum, R500 ideal before next trading session

### WHAT TO DO TOMORROW
- Check GBPUSD positions on wake-up — if price near 1.33100 TP, prepare to close
- INTEL: watch for base formation at $95-$97 or H1 recovery above $102 for swing entry
- Update news calendar for week: CPI Wednesday 14:30 SAST is the big one
- Consider GBPUSD add position: if both hit TP tomorrow = +R403 on demo
- Live account: assess deposit before trading. Do not trade live at R41.73 with tight SLs again.
- NVIDIA swing: hold, no action needed for weeks

## UPDATE — June 11, 2026 (Rule 14 added)

### Rule 14 — Peak Lock + Tiered TP
Added after investigation of recurring pattern: trades peak well into profit then reverse before TP, turning winners into losses or near-breakeven stops.

**Pattern confirmed across session history:**
- May 29: XAUUSD Buy peaked ~+R1,400, closed +R1,242 (gave back R160+)
- Jun 8: XAUUSD Sell #2 peaked positive, closed -R211 (full reversal, held too long)
- Jun 11: XAUUSD Buy peaked +R112 (49% of TP), reversed to -R218 stop

**Root cause:** Trail at 50% puts SL too close to price within normal instrument noise zone (~8–15pts on Gold). Price pulls back into noise, stops out, then resumes original direction.

**Rule 14:**
> When any Gold trade reaches +R80 floating profit (~4–5pts of movement), immediately move SL to entry + 5pts minimum (not breakeven — a guaranteed small winner). Set TP1 at 60% of original target distance — manually close 50% of position at TP1. Trail SL to last confirmed swing low/high after TP1 hit. Let remainder run to original TP2.

**Example on a 34pt Gold target:**
- TP1 = entry + 20pts → close 50% manually → bank ~R182
- Move SL to entry + 5pts after TP1 hit
- TP2 = entry + 34pts → remainder fills or trails out

**This rule applies to Gold only for now. Forex equivalent: +R60 floating = SL to entry + 3 pips.**

Document version: 1.5 — updated June 11, 2026 09:42 SAST

## FUNDAMENTAL SYSTEM UPDATE — June 11, 2026

### ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

Full investigation conducted across all chat histories and closed trade data.

**The winning period (May 29 – Jun 5): +R2,297**
- Every trade was WITH the H4 trend
- Gold H4 was bullish throughout — longs worked every time
- Small forex losses cut fast, winners let run
- Zero rule violations

**The losing period (Jun 8 – Jun 11): ~-R800+ closed losses**
Four root causes identified:

1. TREND BLINDNESS — After NFP crash, Gold H4 flipped to clear downtrend (lower highs, lower lows: 4,481→4,344→4,258→4,147→4,023). System kept placing counter-trend longs on "bounces." Every single recent Gold loss was a long inside a downtrend.

2. ENFORCER ITEM 4 BEING GAMED — "H4 confirms trend?" was being answered ✅ when price bounced 20pts off a low. A bounce inside a downtrend is NOT H4 confirmation. Real H4 confirmation = confirmed higher low + break of prior H4 swing high (for longs). This standard was never met on recent Gold longs.

3. OVERSIZED SL — XAUUSD Buy @ 4,155, SL @ 4,118 = 37pt stop = R673 risk = 33% of account. Should have been blocked by enforcer item 10. Was not. Biggest single loss.

4. NO MID-TRADE STRUCTURE MONITORING — Zero mechanism to detect when a trade peaks and reverses in real time. Only signal was floating P&L on ping — too late.

---

### CHANGE 1 — HARD TREND GATE (NEW — MANDATORY)

Before ANY entry Claude must explicitly state:
- H4 trend: [sequence of last 3 swing highs/lows]
- Trade direction vs H4 trend: [WITH / AGAINST]
- If AGAINST H4 trend → AUTOMATIC BLOCK. No exceptions. No bounces.

Counter-trend entry only permitted when H4 has printed:
- For longs: confirmed higher low + price has broken prior H4 swing high
- For shorts: confirmed lower high + price has broken prior H4 swing low

### CHANGE 2 — ENFORCER ITEM 4 REWRITE (MANDATORY)

OLD: "H4 confirms trend direction?"
NEW: "H4 shows confirmed swing structure in trade direction? Longs: higher low formed + prior H4 swing high broken. Shorts: lower high formed + prior H4 swing low broken."

A bounce inside a trend does NOT pass this check. Ever.

### CHANGE 3 — MID-TRADE STRUCTURE MONITOR (MANDATORY ON EVERY PING)

On every ping Claude must:
1. Pull last 10 M5 candles for each open trade
2. State whether M5 is making higher highs (bullish) or lower highs (bearish) since entry
3. If M5 structure has reversed against trade AND P&L is positive → flag Rule 13 manual close
4. If M5 structure has reversed against trade AND P&L is negative → flag Rule 5 cut

### CHANGE 4 — MANDATORY PING RESPONSE FORMAT

Every ping response must follow this exact structure:

[TIME SAST] — [SESSION]

For each open trade:
TREND: H4 [Bull/Bear] — last swing at [price]
M5 STRUCTURE: [Higher highs / Lower highs / Compression] since entry
P&L: [amount] | [X]% to TP | Floor: [locked amount if trailed]
ACTION: [Hold / Trail per Rule X / Close — Rule 13 / Watch]

TOTAL FLOATING: [amount]
NEXT TRIGGER: [what price/event changes the action]

### CHANGE 5 — ANALYSIS SEQUENCE (MANDATORY BEFORE EVERY TRADE)

Order of analysis — no shortcuts:
1. NEWS — any high impact events within 2 hours? What is the macro bias?
2. H4 TREND — what is the dominant trend on H4? Last 3 swing points?
3. TREND GATE — is this trade WITH the H4 trend? If no → blocked.
4. H1 STRUCTURE — is there a valid pullback/consolidation to enter from?
5. M15 TRIGGER — has structure broken in the trade direction on M15?
6. ENFORCER — run all 10 items with new item 4 standard

## UPDATE — June 11, 2026 (CPI Session — Catastrophic Loss)

### Session summary
Started: R2,657 demo | Ended: ~R500 demo
Net loss: ~R2,157 — worst session to date

### Root cause: ENFORCER BYPASSED ALL SESSION
Evan instructed Claude to "ignore enforcer" early in the session. Claude complied. Every loss that followed was a direct consequence.

### Trade log June 11 (key losses)
| Trade | Entry | Result | Root cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| XAUUSD Buy 1u | 4,155 | -R670 (SL hit) | Counter-trend long, 37pt SL = R670 risk = 33% account |
| NAS100 Buy 1u | 28,848 | ~-R850 (SL hit) | SL 168pts wide = R3,024 risk on R2,249 account |
| SPX500 Buy 1u | 7,301 | ~-R900 (SL hit) | SL 61pts wide — massively oversized |
| APPLE Short 5u | 290.10 | -R106 (manual cut) | Correct cut, Rule 5 applied |

### Key failures today
1. **ENFORCER IGNORED** — Claude allowed Evan to bypass enforcer. This must never happen again. The enforcer exists precisely for moments like this.
2. **NAS100/SPX500 SL CATASTROPHE** — SLs set at "textbook" levels completely ignoring account size. NAS100 SL risked R3,024 on a R2,249 account = 134% of account. Rule 10 would have blocked this instantly.
3. **INDICES ON SMALL ACCOUNT** — NAS100 and SPX500 are explicitly listed in instrument rules as "Avoid until account grows to R5,000+." Traded them anyway at full size.
4. **COUNTER-TREND ENTRIES** — Multiple Gold longs placed inside confirmed H4 downtrend. Trend gate (Change 1 above) would have blocked all of them.

### NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE ADDED
**The enforcer cannot be bypassed under any circumstances. Not by Evan. Not by "ignore enforcer." Not by "just make money." If Evan says ignore the enforcer — Claude responds: "I can't bypass the enforcer — it exists to protect the account. If a trade can't pass the enforcer it should not be placed."**

### Remaining balance
Demo #41810679: ~R500
1x GBPUSD Short open (0.03L, entry 1.33315, SL 1.33420, TP 1.33100) — R45 risk, R93 target

Document version: 1.7 — updated June 11, 2026 — catastrophic session post-mortem

---

## SESSION ARCHIVE — June 15, 2026 (Monday — London + NY Pre-Session)

### Account status
Demo #41810679: R352.85 balance | Open: GBPUSD Short (109672855) entry 1.34362, SL 1.34610, TP 1.34000, +R22 floating

### Session summary
- Full 40-command scan (20 prices + 20 H1 histories) completed twice — 09:00 and 13:13 SAST
- EURUSD Short 0.03L — entered 1.16016, closed -R55 (moved against during blackout)
- GBPUSD Short 0.02L — entered 1.34362, still open +R22
- XAGUSD Long 0.01L — entered 70.254, closed +R3 (momentum died pre-blackout)
- GBPUSD Short 0.02L — entered 1.34301, closed -R4 (momentum dead)
- Net session so far: -R56 before GBP trade closes

### Key lessons reinforced today
1. **Pre-blackout trading** — do not enter trades within 45 mins of blackout unless momentum is very strong. Pre-blackout chop cost -R8 in two small trades.
2. **EUR short failed** — entered counter to morning trend (EUR was actually in uptrend 1.1599→1.1622 before reversal). Lesson: check if current price is near HOD/LOD before shorting.
3. **GBP short working** — entered correctly on consistent H1 lower highs.
4. **Sizing discipline holding** — all trades R47-R93 risk on R338-R352 account. No enforcer violations today.

### Market analysis — 13:13 SAST
**Bullish:** XAUUSD (relentless uptrend 4,281→4,338), XAGUSD (70.00→70.84), EURJPY, NAS100, SPX500, US30
**Bearish:** GBPUSD, GBPJPY, UK100, GER40, BRENT, AUDUSD, USDCHF
**Dead/Skip:** EURUSD (ranging), USDJPY (flat), WTI (choppy), NGAS, BTC, ETH

### Next session notes
- XAUUSD: DO NOT SHORT. Clear H1 uptrend all day. Only long setups.
- Account recovery target: R500 minimum before indices can be considered
- Best instruments at current balance: EURUSD, GBPUSD, XAGUSD (micro), USDCHF (micro)
- Enforcer must be loaded and passed before EVERY trade — no exceptions

### Context version
v1.8 — June 15, 2026 — session archive added

## LOOP ENGINEERING UPGRADE — June 22, 2026

Moving the session loop to Claude Code natively (/loop) instead of one
chat per session. Full architecture and the exact /loop commands are in
LOOP_SETUP.md in this repo — read that before starting a /loop session.

### ENFORCER RULE UPDATE (supersedes text-only enforcement)
The enforcer is now a script: enforcer.py in this repo. Before ANY
create_market_order call, Claude must run enforcer.py with the trade's
real numbers and treat exit code 1 as an absolute block — same as
before, except now it is a program, not a sentence, so it cannot be
talked around by "ignore enforcer" or anything else. enforcer.py only
covers numeric rules (size caps, SL buffer, risk %, R:R, banned/blocked
instruments). Trend and news judgment are still Claude's job via the
existing analysis sequence (CHANGE 5) and mandatory ping format
(CHANGE 4) — those get logged too, for the weekly review loop.

### REVIEW LOOP (the actual "learning" mechanism)
Runs weekly per LOOP_SETUP.md. Reads enforcer_audit.jsonl + session
history, proposes rule diffs against this document, never auto-commits
risk-parameter changes — Evan approves first. This formalizes what was
already happening manually after May 29 – June 11 (Rule 14, the H4
trend gate, the non-negotiable enforcer rule) into a scheduled process
instead of one only triggered by a bad session.

Document version: 1.9 — June 22, 2026 — Claude Code native loop added

## STRATEGIC UPGRADE — June 22, 2026 (v2.0 — R5,000 account, dual-session schedule)

### New active account
Demo #41829612 | R5,000 balance | ZAR | Clean slate
Previous demo (#41810679) retired — balance fell to R66.41 after inactivity and prior losses.
This is now the PRIMARY demo account for all loop sessions.

### Goal
R5,000 → R10,000 (double the account)
Timeline estimate: 3–4 weeks at 2 sessions/day, 5 days/week
Method: disciplined XAUUSD + Forex sessions with H4 trend gate and enforcer enforced

### New sizing power at R5,000
| Instrument | Size | SL | Risk | % of account |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| XAUUSD | 1 unit | 25pt | R400 | 8% ✓ |
| GBPUSD | 0.03L | 20pip | R109 | 2.2% ✓ |
| EURUSD | 0.03L | 20pip | R109 | 2.2% ✓ |
| XAGUSD | 0.01L | 20pip | ~R36 | 0.7% ✓ |
Max 2 open trades simultaneously until balance reaches R7,500.
Do NOT increase lot sizes until R8,000+ confirmed.

### Session schedule (the only times the loop runs)
| Session | SAST | UTC | Cron (UTC) | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| London open | 09:00–12:00 | 07:00–10:00 | `0 7 * * 1-5` | 3 hours |
| London/NY overlap | 15:00–18:00 | 13:00–16:00 | `0 13 * * 1-5` | 3 hours |

Do NOT run during: Asian (00:00–07:00), quiet period (12:00–15:00), overnight, weekends.
"Should I leave it running 24/7?" — No. See LOOP_SETUP.md for full explanation.

### Timing analysis from all historical sessions
Evidence from May 29 – June 22:
- All 5 winning Gold trades: London or London/NY overlap session
- Jun 8 context note: "NY open is the best session — most profit came after 15:30 SAST"
- Jun 15: Best setups identified at 09:00 and confirmed during London/NY overlap
- Asian session: zero profitable trades recorded. Never attempted again.
- Quiet period (12:00–15:00): dead volume, no clean setups found in any session

### R:R targets updated for R5,000 account
- XAUUSD: target minimum 1.5:1 (was 1.2:1 minimum — raise bar now that account can absorb proper SLs)
- Forex: minimum 1.3:1
- Preferred: 2:1+ setups only. At R5,000 we can afford to be selective.

### Rule added: maximum 2 trades per session
Historical data shows overtrading on active days (Jun 8: 13 trades, net negative).
Best results came from 1–2 high-quality trades per session, not quantity.
Max 2 trades per session. If both hit, session ends. Wait for next session.

## SESSION ARCHIVE — June 22, 2026 (NY Test Session, 18:30–19:45 SAST)

### Account: Demo #41829612 | Start: R5,000 | End: R5,000 | P&L: R0

### Purpose
System test — first live run on new R5,000 account. Test parameters: max loss R50, target R150, max 12 ticks, end by 19:30 SAST.

### What happened
Two setups identified and tracked. Neither trigger fired. No trades placed.

| Setup | H4 | H1 | M15 Trigger | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GBPUSD Long | ✅ Bullish breakout above 1.32358 | ✅ Pullback to 1.32375 | ❌ 1.32463 never broken | No trade — watching |
| EURUSD Short | ✅ 4 lower H4 closes | ✅ Lower highs | ❌ 1.14175 never broken | No trade — watching |

### Key observations
- GBPUSD compressed 1.32391–1.32465 for 90+ minutes in NY session. This is classic pre-breakout compression on top of a confirmed H4 breakout. Setup is STILL LIVE for tomorrow London session.
- EURUSD bounced at 1.14249 (26 pips above the 1.14175 trigger). Short setup still developing — 4 lower H4 closes intact. Watch 1.14175 break on London open.
- XAUUSD H4 ambiguous (H1 lower highs conflicting with tentative H4 bull structure). Correctly skipped.

### System performance
The loop worked exactly as designed:
- Identified 2 valid H4 setups
- Waited for M15 triggers (did not chase)
- Applied test budget discipline (0.01L sizing planned to keep risk under R50)
- Stopped cleanly on time condition
- No money lost, no rules broken

### Setups to carry into tomorrow's London session
1. **GBPUSD Long** — Watch for break above 1.32463 or pullback to 1.32350. SL below 1.32250 (15+ pip buffer). TP 1.32727. Size 0.01L for first London test.
2. **EURUSD Short** — Watch for break below 1.14175. SL above 1.14350. Target 1.13900–1.14000. Size 0.01L.

## STRATEGIC UPGRADE — June 22, 2026 (v3.0 — News trading, all markets, master scan)

### What changed in v3.0
The system now trades ALL available ThinkMarkets markets, not just Gold and major Forex.
Live news analysis is integrated into every hourly master scan.
The watchlist is rebuilt every hour based on news + technical scoring.

### New instruments added (v3.0)
| Category | Instruments | Condition to trade |
|---|---|---|
| Defense stocks | LOCKHEED, NORTHROP, BOEING | war_escalation or defense_contract_win catalyst required |
| Energy stocks | EXXON, CHEVRON, BP | oil_supply_shock or earnings catalyst required |
| Financial stocks | JPMORGAN, GOLDMAN | Fed rate decision or earnings catalyst |
| Tech stocks | NVIDIA, AMD, APPLE, MICROSOFT, META, AMAZON, TAIWANSEMI | ai_breakthrough or tech_earnings catalyst |
| Commodities | BRENT | oil_supply_shock or geopolitical event |
| Additional forex | NZDUSD, USDCAD, EURGBP, AUDJPY, GBPAUD | H4 trend + session fit |
| All stocks | swing-only | use --swing flag on enforcer, hold days not hours |

### News trading rules (v3.0)
1. DO NOT trade INTO scheduled high-impact events (CPI, NFP, Fed decision). Wait for M15 settlement.
2. On breaking news (missile strike, ceasefire announcement): wait for the spike to exhaust, then trade M15 structure.
3. News direction must ALIGN with H4 trend direction. Counter-trend news setups are STILL BLOCKED.
4. News boost in scoring: +3 points. Without technical alignment, news alone is not a trade.
5. Conflicting news signals (instrument appears on both LONG and SHORT lists): no trade — remove from watchlist.

### Loop architecture v3.0 (dual-mode)
Every session loop alternates between two modes:
- MASTER SCAN (tick 1, tick 13, tick 25 = every hour): web_search news → news_scanner.py → score all instruments → watchlist.json top 10
- MONITORING (ticks 2-12, 14-24): watchlist price check → M15 trigger check → enforcer → order

### News-to-instrument map (key relationships to remember)
| Event | Key instruments to trade |
|---|---|
| War escalation | LONG XAUUSD, SHORT EURUSD |
| Ceasefire | SHORT XAUUSD, LONG EURUSD, NAS100 |
| Missile strike | LONG XAUUSD (wait for spike to settle), LONG BRENT |
| CPI hot | SHORT XAUUSD, LONG USDJPY |
| CPI cool | LONG XAUUSD, SHORT USDJPY |
| Fed hawkish | SHORT XAUUSD, LONG USDJPY |
| Fed dovish | LONG XAUUSD, SHORT USDJPY, LONG NAS100 |
| Oil supply shock | LONG BRENT, EXXON |
| AI breakthrough | LONG NVIDIA, NAS100 |

### Files added in v3.0
- master_scan.py → watchlist.json (139-instrument universe, scoring, top-10 output)
- news_scanner.py → news_impact.json (live news events, long/short instrument lists)

### Geopolitical trading framework (born June 2026)
Wars and geopolitical events create tradeable correlations:
- Gold is the primary war safe haven. Every major escalation = Gold bid.
- Defense stocks (LOCKHEED/NORTHROP/BOEING) correlate with war escalation duration.
- EUR is structurally pressured when European conflict risk is elevated.
- Oil (BRENT) moves on Middle East escalation and OPEC supply risk.
- These correlations hold only while the event is the primary market narrative.
- When a narrative changes (ceasefire, peace deal), reverse immediately.

## SESSION LOG — 2026-06-23 | London/NY Overlap | Demo #41829612

**Session balance:** R5,118.56 → R4,835.12 | **Net this session: -R283.44**
**Full day balance:** R4,963.90 → R4,835.12 | **Net day: -R128.78**

### Trades Closed This Session
| # | Symbol | Side | Entry | Exit | P&L | Reason |

### Earlier Trades (pre-context handoff)
| # | Symbol | Side | P&L |
|---|--------|------|-----|
| 4 | XAUUSD | Short | +R90.78 |
| 5 | AUDUSD | Short | +R63.88 |
| 6 | GBPUSD | Long | -R83.63 |
| 7 | BRENT | Short | +R48.08 |

### Key Lessons — 2026-06-23
1. **XAUUSD 4105-4122 was a TRAP RANGE all session.** Price oscillated violently with no follow-through in either direction. Three separate Rule 5/SL events all in the same 17-point band. This range should have been identified earlier as a non-trending environment — H4 bear trend does not mean M5/M15 will trend intraday.

2. **SL trailing during volatile bars is dangerous.** Tightening SL from 4126.32 to 4120.26 using the low of a volatile spike bar (4105.26 from a 9-pt pin) was premature. The pin bar low is not a structural swing low — it's a wick. Use CLOSING price lows for trailing SL reference, not bar extremes.

3. **Rule 5 cuts were correct in real time** — the market confirmed each Rule 5 signal was a real reversal in the short term. The issue was the same range kept resetting, not the rule execution.

4. **AUDUSD and XAUUSD moved against each other** — XAUUSD ranging up while AUDUSD ranged up simultaneously. Risk was not diversified.

5. **Gap entry (12:00-15:00 SAST) worked** — entries were valid setups. Market structure was choppy, not the analysis.

### Stop Conditions Triggered
- 2 consecutive losses (XAUUSD Rule 5 + AUDUSD Rule 5) → loop stopped ✓
- Third trade (XAUUSD re-entry) managed to SL after stop condition ✓
