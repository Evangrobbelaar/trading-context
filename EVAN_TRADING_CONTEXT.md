## INSTRUMENT RULES

### XAUUSD (Gold) — PRIMARY INSTRUMENT
- 1 unit MAXIMUM. NEVER 3 units. Never.
- ~R16/pt at 1 unit
- 3 units = ~R48/pt = R1,000+ risk on 21pt SL (confirmed by platform screenshot)
- Pending stop orders DO NOT work on XAUUSD — market orders only
- Minimum SL buffer: 15-25 pts
- XAUUSD247: weekends only, spread 8x wider (2.37 vs 0.19) — exceptional setups only

### FOREX (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY)
- 0.01 lots overnight swing trades
- 0.03 lots intraday during London/NY open
- Never exceed 0.03 lots on R2,000 account
- Minimum SL buffer: 15-25 pips
- GBPUSD at 0.10 lots = ~R16/pip (similar value to Gold 1 unit)

### NAS100 / INDICES
- At 0.01 lots = ~R1.30/pt — not worth it
- Avoid until account grows to R5,000+
- Minimum SL buffer: 80-150 pts

### AVOID ENTIRELY
- WTI (Crude Oil) — too news/spread driven
- BTCUSD/ETHUSD — $15 spread, random spikes, no clean structure
- GER40 overnight — wide spread, no liquidity

---

## SESSION SCHEDULE (SAST = UTC+2)
| Session | SAST Time | Best Instruments |
|---|---|---|
| Asian | Midnight-7am | Forex, Gold, Crypto |
| London open | 9am-12pm | Gold, EURUSD, GBPUSD (BEST) |
| London/NY overlap | 3pm-6pm | Gold, NAS100, SPX500 |
| NY close | 10pm | Wind down |
| Weekend | Sat/Sun | Markets closed (XAUUSD247 only) |

---

## NEWS CALENDAR RULES
- Always web_search news before every trade session
- High impact events: NFP, CPI, Fed speeches, JOLTS, ADP, PMI, GDP
- Avoid new entries within 2 hours BEFORE high impact news
- NFP drops Fridays at 2:30pm SAST — no trades before 4:30pm SAST
- Directional bias:
  - Stagflation/geopolitical risk = bullish Gold
  - Rate hike fears/strong USD = bearish Gold
  - Strong jobs beat (NFP/ADP) = USD up = Gold down
  - Weak jobs data = USD down = Gold up
- Post-news: wait for M15 compression + double bottom/top before entering (Rule 12)

---

## PRE-TRADE CHECKLIST (run before every single trade)
1. News scan done? Any events within 2 hours?
2. Correct session for this instrument?
3. 5+ instruments scanned? Is this the best setup?
4. H4 confirms trend direction?
5. H1 shows pullback/consolidation?
6. M15 shows structure breaking in trend direction?
7. Lot size correct for account and instrument?
8. SL behind structural level with correct buffer?
9. R:R minimum 1.2:1?
10. Risk per trade under 20% of account?

---

## PRE-TRAIL CHECKLIST (before every SL move)
1. Has price made a new swing point in my direction?
2. Is the new SL behind a structural level?
3. Is the buffer wider than the instrument noise zone?
4. Am I trailing out of fear or because structure changed? If fear — LEAVE IT.

---

## TRADING RULES

Rule 1: Never trail SL to breakeven. Trail to nearest structural level with room to breathe.
Rule 2: Min buffers: Forex 15-25 pips, Gold 15-25 pts, Indices 80-150 pts. SL outside noise zone.
Rule 3: Only trail after new swing point confirms in trade direction. No trailing just because in profit.
Rule 4: 50% rule — at 50%+ of TP, trail SL to lock in roughly half unrealized profit, not all.
Rule 5: Cut losers fast, let winners run. Bounce hard off TP area and reverses — close immediately.
Rule 6: Match instrument to session. Asian: Forex/Gold/Crypto. London: EUR/GBP/Gold. NY: NAS100/SPX500/Gold. Never trade closed markets.
Rule 7: Always scan 5+ instruments. Best setup wins — not the first one found.
Rule 8: Sizing for ~R2,000 account: 0.01 lots overnight, 0.03 lots intraday. Gold: 1 unit MAX. Rule 2 always overrides sizing.
Rule 9: H4+H1+M15 confluence = entry. Min R:R 1.2:1. Set TP, let it fill. Never move TP out of greed.
Rule 10: Cut dead trades only after BOTH: hours open with no TP progress AND structure weakened.
Rule 11: News scan before every trade. Avoid within 2 hours of major news. Use for directional bias.
Rule 12: Post-news Gold — wait for M15 compression and double bottom/top. Never chase the spike.
Rule 13: At 60%+ of TP with stalling momentum near S/R — close manually and bank profit.

---

## CRITICAL LESSONS (never repeat these)

1. GOLD 3 UNITS = ACCOUNT KILLER. R1,042 SL risk on 21pt stop confirmed by screenshot. 1 unit ONLY.
2. NAS100 at 0.01 lots = R1.30/pt. 150pt target = R195. Not worth it on this account size.
3. Never trail SL to breakeven. Lost R73 on XAUUSD short — 4pt buffer on 25pt instrument. Gold hit stop then continued right direction.
4. Dead trades kill opportunity. USDJPY held overnight zero progress. Cut after one full session if structure weakens.
5. Spread kills scalping. AI latency makes true scalping unreliable — execution speed is the bottleneck.
6. Post-news bounces work. JOLTS crashed Gold to 4,447 — double bottom — bounced to 4,473 = R205. Always wait for M15 compression first.
7. Bank profit when momentum stalls. Closed Gold buy at +R205 instead of last 15pts — right call, momentum fading into resistance.
8. ThinkTrader MCP drops after extended inactivity. New conversation to reconnect. Verify account at session start.
9. Always determine time from market data — never ask Evan what time it is.
10. AI memory rules unreliable for process steps. THIS GitHub document is single source of truth. Always fetch first.
11. If Claude has not confirmed "Context loaded" — tell it: "Read your context file first."
12. Claude can commit to GitHub directly using bash git commands. No need to ask Evan to paste files manually.

## UPDATE — June 5, 2026 (post-NFP)

NFP Result: 172,000 jobs added vs 85,000 forecast — massive beat.
Gold reaction: Crashed from 4,481 to 4,314 — a 167pt drop.
USD surged ~30pts on Dollar Index.

No trades placed post-NFP — correct decision. Rule 12 compression never formed.
Gold continued lower all afternoon with no bounce structure.

Key lesson: After a massive NFP beat, Gold can fall 150+ pts without a clean bounce setup.
Do not try to catch the falling knife on strong NFP days. Wait for Monday reset.

Week of June 1-5 final P&L:
| Date | Trade | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Jun 2026 | XAUUSD Sell | +R594 |
| 1 Jun 2026 | XAUUSD Buy | +R205 |
| 2 Jun 2026 | XAUUSD Buy | +R147 |

| Week total | | +R946 |

## PRE-TRADE ENFORCER — MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL
Version added: 1.3 — June 5, 2026

This protocol is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Claude MUST complete this BEFORE calling create_market_order on ANY trade. No exceptions. No shortcuts. If Claude skips this, Evan must say "Run the enforcer first."

### ENFORCER TEMPLATE
Claude must output this EXACTLY before every trade execution:

```
=== PRE-TRADE ENFORCER ===
Instrument: [instrument]
Direction: [Buy/Sell]
Entry: [price]
SL: [price] ([X] pts/pips from entry)
TP: [price] ([X] pts/pips from entry)
Size: [lots/units]
R:R: [X:1]

CHECKLIST:
1. News scan done? No events within 2 hours?         [✅/❌]
2. Correct session for this instrument?               [✅/❌]
3. 5+ instruments scanned? This is the best setup?   [✅/❌]
4. H4 confirms trend direction?                       [✅/❌]
5. H1 shows pullback/consolidation?                  [✅/❌]
6. M15 shows structure breaking in trend direction?  [✅/❌]
7. Lot size correct for account and instrument?       [✅/❌]
8. SL behind structural level with correct buffer?   [✅/❌]
9. R:R minimum 1.2:1?                                [✅/❌]
10. Risk under 20% of account?                        [✅/❌]

RESULT: [ALL PASSED — EXECUTING] or [FAILED — ITEM X — NOT PLACING]
=========================
```

### ENFORCER RULES
- ALL 10 items must return ✅ before execution
- A single ❌ = trade does not get placed — no exceptions
- If ANY item fails, Claude must explain why and what needs to change
- Claude must calculate R:R and risk % explicitly — no estimating
- For Gold: Item 7 must confirm "1 unit" — never 3 units
- For Forex: Item 7 must confirm lot size vs account size
- The enforcer output must appear BEFORE the create_market_order call
- If Claude executes without showing the enforcer — Evan says "Enforcer first" and Claude cancels and reruns

### ENFORCER EXAMPLES

GOOD — trade placed:
```
=== PRE-TRADE ENFORCER ===
Instrument: XAUUSD
Direction: Buy
Entry: 4,461
SL: 4,442 (19pts)
TP: 4,490 (29pts)
Size: 1 unit
R:R: 1.5:1

1. News scan done? No JOLTS/NFP/Fed today              ✅
2. London session — correct for Gold                   ✅
3. Scanned Gold, NAS100, EUR, GBP, JPY — Gold best    ✅
4. H4 bullish — higher lows from 4,366                ✅
5. H1 pulled back from 4,595 HOD to 4,447             ✅
6. M15 double bottom at 4,447 — bounce forming        ✅
7. 1 unit Gold — correct per Rule 8                   ✅
8. SL below double bottom with 19pt buffer            ✅
9. R:R = 1.5:1 — above 1.2 minimum                   ✅
10. Risk = 19pts x R16 = R304 = 15% account           ✅

RESULT: ALL PASSED — EXECUTING
=========================
```

BAD — trade blocked:
```
=== PRE-TRADE ENFORCER ===
Instrument: XAUUSD
Direction: Buy
Entry: 4,461
SL: 4,442 (19pts)
TP: 4,490 (29pts)
Size: 3 units
R:R: 1.5:1

1. News scan done?                                     ✅
2. Correct session?                                    ✅
3. 5+ instruments scanned?                             ✅
4. H4 confirms trend?                                  ✅
5. H1 pullback?                                        ✅
6. M15 structure?                                      ✅
7. Lot size correct? 3 units = R48/pt = R912 risk      ❌
8. SL behind structure?                                ✅
9. R:R 1.5:1                                           ✅
10. Risk under 20%? R912 = 44% of account              ❌

RESULT: FAILED — ITEMS 7 AND 10 — NOT PLACING
Reason: Gold sizing is 3 units — MAXIMUM is 1 unit per Rule 8.
Fix: Reduce to 1 unit and rerun enforcer.
=========================
```

## UPDATE — June 8, 2026 (Monday Weekly Update)

Monday open context:
- Gold closed Friday at ~4,366 (NFP crash: 4,481 → 4,314, partial weekend recovery)
- Weekend XAUUSD247 range: 4,290–4,320, spread 4.06pts (8x normal)
- Yearly open support: 4,319 — critical level this week
- No trades placed over the weekend — correct (spread + no structure)

Week plan:
- Monday: Watch London open 9am SAST. Wait for M15 compression at 4,319 support or break below it.
  - Scenario A (above 4,319 holds): Long with SL below 4,300, TP 4,370 (~2.5:1)
  - Scenario B (breaks below 4,319): Short on pullback, SL above 4,340, TP 4,270 (~2.5:1)
- Tuesday: NO TRADES before 16:30 SAST (CPI at 14:30 SAST)
- Live account: R65.89 — too small to trade. Fund to R1,000 minimum before any live trades.

## UPDATE — June 8, 2026 (Monday Session Trades)

### Trades placed and closed today:

| Time | Trade | Entry | Exit | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11:10 SAST | USDJPY Buy (live) | 160.275 | 160.10 SL | -R19 | SL too tight post-NFP, Monday retracement |
| 11:15 SAST | GBPUSD Sell (demo) | 1.33243 | 1.33400 manual close | -R83 | Structure reversed — M15 flipped bullish, closed before SL |
| 11:50 SAST | NVIDIA Buy (demo) | 208.48 | OPEN | — | Swing position [SWING] — see lock protocol |

### Lessons learned today:
- Post-NFP pairs (especially JPY) need wider SLs on Monday — retracement volatility is 1.5-2x normal
- GBPUSD short thesis was valid (USD strength) but London session saw GBP recover — check if news catalyst drove reversal before next GBP short
- Cutting at -R83 vs waiting for -R140 SL = correct Rule 5 application. Saved R57.
- Demo session P&L today: -R83 (GBPUSD) | NVIDIA open
- Live session P&L today: -R19 (USDJPY)
- Live account balance: R47.16

### Monday June 8 net: -R102 demo intraday | NVIDIA swing open

## JUNE 8 — LEARNINGS FOR EVAN TO CURATE

### SESSION MECHANICS — what worked
- SL trail to breakeven rule saved multiple positions from turning losses
- Cutting GBPUSD at -R83 (Rule 5) saved R57 vs waiting for SL
- Gold first trade: entry 4332, SL trailed to 4323 — locked R179 automatically
- EURUSD cut early when SL distance was only 7p — avoided potential -R95 loss
- Multi-instrument USD shorts (GBP + EUR + Gold) all fired together on same thesis = valid approach
- NY open is the best session — most of the day's profit came after 15:30 SAST

### SESSION MECHANICS — what didn't work
- Re-entering a trade immediately after manual close at tight SL = stop hunt risk (GBPUSD live trade 2)
- Taking 3 live trades in quick succession on a R47 account = account drawn down to R41.73
- Gold re-entry (second XAUUSD short) entered at wrong time — bounced hard against us, -R211
- EURUSD 0.06L double down — aggressive sizing caught a bounce, required early exit
- Post-NFP Monday pairs (JPY especially) have 1.5-2x normal retracement volatility — wider SLs needed

### LIVE ACCOUNT INSIGHTS
- R47 is too small to trade safely — any SL under 20 pips risks 40%+ of account
- Tight SLs (4-7 pips) get stopped by spread noise and stop hunts
- Three live trades all lost or barely broke even — need minimum R300-500 deposit
- GBPUSD at 0.01L with 6-7p SL = structural problem, not bad trading
- One trade that worked (manual close +R14.52) worked because we managed it manually not via SL

### INSTRUMENT INSIGHTS
- XAUUSD (Gold): R18.20/pt at 0.01 lots. Highly profitable when right but punishing when wrong. Need 20pt+ SL minimum.
- GBPUSD: R5.46/pip at 0.03L. Most consistent performer today — two separate setups both worked directionally.
- EURUSD: R5.46/pip at 0.03L. Similar to GBP, same USD thesis. More volatile during NY session — watch HOD/LOD carefully.
- USDJPY: Post-NFP USD spike faded Monday — wrong entry timing, not wrong thesis.
- NVIDIA (shares): R1.82/dollar at 0.1L. Swing only — too slow for intraday. NY session noise ±$2.
- TM_VOLATILITY_50 (synthetic): Could not place orders — likely account permissions issue. Revisit.
- UK shares (LLOYDS etc): P&L too small at 0.01L (R0.23/pt) — not viable for small account.

### STRATEGY INSIGHTS
- USD strength theme post-NFP is a multi-day thesis — GBP and EUR shorts work on this
- Mean reversion: Gold oscillated 4268-4353 all day. Selling HOD rejections is valid.
- Double-down works IF sizing is controlled AND entry is at clear S/R — aggressive sizing on bounces dangerous
- Swing positions (NVIDIA) should be completely separate from intraday — different timeframe, different rules
- INTEL thesis still valid but entered downtrend — wait for H1 base to form before swing entry (~$95-$97 or recovery above $102)

### RULES TO CONSIDER (for Evan to decide)
- [ ] Add post-NFP rule: widen SL by 50% on all pairs for first 2 London sessions after NFP
- [ ] Add re-entry rule: minimum 15 min cooldown after manual close before re-entering same instrument same direction
- [ ] Add live account rule: maximum 1 live trade per session until balance exceeds R300
- [ ] Add double-down rule: maximum 0.06L total on any single instrument during double-down
- [ ] Consider adding: mandatory 25% progress before SL trail (currently doing this informally)
- [ ] Consider adding: CPI/FOMC rule — no new positions within 48hrs of high-impact event (currently 24hr)
- [ ] Live account deposit target: R300 minimum, R500 ideal before next trading session

### WHAT TO DO TOMORROW
- Check GBPUSD positions on wake-up — if price near 1.33100 TP, prepare to close
- INTEL: watch for base formation at $95-$97 or H1 recovery above $102 for swing entry
- Update news calendar for week: CPI Wednesday 14:30 SAST is the big one
- Consider GBPUSD add position: if both hit TP tomorrow = +R403 on demo
- Live account: assess deposit before trading. Do not trade live at R41.73 with tight SLs again.
- NVIDIA swing: hold, no action needed for weeks
